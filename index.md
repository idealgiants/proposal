## Ideal Giants: Turn Up Lights Inside Your Self

> If men identified introspectively their inner states one tenth as correctly as they identify objective reality, we would be a race of ideal giants. I ascribe ninety-five percent or more of all psychological trouble and personal tragedies to the fact that in the realm of introspection we are on the level where savages were (or lower) in regard to extrospection. Men are not only not taught to introspect, they are actively discouraged from engaging  in introspection, and yet their lives depend on it... This is a field of which we are merely glimpsing the first stages, and yet look at the enormity of the disasters possible to man in that realm.

### What

This is a Productiveness Grant proposal submitted to the Prometheus Foundation. The proposed Ideal Giants project will consolidate Objectivist principles that guide individuals in fully integrating their thoughts, values, principles, actions, plans, and vision for life. The project will also integrate relevant material from psychology and fields such as personal-development, to the extent that the material is consistent with Objectivist epistemology. The project aspires to become a canonical source of theory, practice, and tools for personal integration. Products will include one or more books, a podcast/video series, a website with reference and learning material, and an active community to develop the topic into the future.

### Why

A common takeaway from Objectivist content is, “Be integrated” (especially Peikoff’s _The DIM Hypothesis_). Every time my reaction is, “But how, specifically, concretely?” The best advice for methods of being integrated in one’s own life seem to be along the lines of, "think about your life," "take time to reflect," "keep a journal," "talk to yourself in the shower," "meditate," or “work with a therapist.”

Contrast the rigor of proper method described in Harriman and Peikoff’s _The Logical Leap_ and Binswanger’s _How We Know_. Whereas the scientific method is established and respected for the physical sciences, a scientific method _of self_ seems nonexistent. Regarding the introspection requisite for any self-awareness, rigorous or not, Rand observed, “This is a field of which we are merely glimpsing the first stages” (_ITOE_, p. 227). For the field of self awareness and integration, there is much to be done. Ideal Giants endeavors to do it.

### Vision

The project intends to inspire people to crave and automatize integration principles in order to live their fullest lives. Just as most adults and children think of the scientific method as the proper way to understand the external world, Ideal Giants envisions a future in which most people think of this personally applicable "scientific method of self" as the proper way to know one's internal world and shape one’s self.

Responding to the ubiquity of improper integration, Peikoff’s _DIM Hypothesis_ projects minimal optimism for the fate of the West. However, Peikoff mentions that “a resurgence of Aristotle is still possible. There is some evidence now pointing to the germ of an I revolution in the United States" (p. 342). The Ideal Giants project seeks to propel the I revolution by empowering individuals to reach superior self awareness, turning up the lights inside their selves.

With this internal clarity, people can use the project’s integration principles and methods to operate in the I mode as much as possible, achieving unprecedented consistency across all aspects of their lives. They will be the ideal giants who, quite frankly, may save civilization. Ayn Rand identified that “the battle of human history is fought and determined by those who are predominantly consistent” (_For the New Intellectual_, p. 21).

### Content

The Ideal Giants project will produce content targeting two primary audiences. First and most important is the general public audience, anyone interested in personal development. Content for this audience will be presented in an accessible and straightforward manner, avoiding academese. The second audience is academics in psychology and any in philosophy who respect Objectivism. Content for this audience intends to be rigorous seminal works on the topic of self integration, achieving credibility and utility in these academic fields. Ideally, psychologists in universities and in clinical practice will use and recommend the content to trainees and clients.
