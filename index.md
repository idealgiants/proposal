## Ideal Giants: Turn the Lights On Inside Your Self

This is an NIF grant proposal for the Ideal Giants project. The project will explore Ayn Rand's work on psycho-epistemology for its implications for developing and presenting an applied method for how individuals can become fully integrated selves. The project aims to ultimately produce one or more books, a podcast/video series, and a website with reference and learning material.
