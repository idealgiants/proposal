## Ideal Giants: Turn Up Lights Inside Your Self

> If men identified introspectively their inner states one tenth as correctly as they identify objective reality, we would be a race of ideal giants. I ascribe ninety-five percent or more of all psychological trouble and personal tragedies to the fact that in the realm of introspection we are on the level where savages were (or lower) in regard to extrospection. Men are not only not taught to introspect, they are actively discouraged from engaging  in introspection, and yet their lives depend on it... This is a field of which we are merely glimpsing the first stages, and yet look at the enormity of the disasters possible to man in that realm.

This project is in the EARLY stages. It intends to become a canonical source of theory, practice, and tools for personal integration. There is more to come, later.
